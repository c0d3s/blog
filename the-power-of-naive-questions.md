### **The Power of Naïve Questions**

A good leader isn’t afraid to ask naïve questions. A good leader uses naïvety as a tool.

Sometimes, those questions come from genuinely not knowing the answer. This is often true for me. But more often, they’re a deliberate tool to **expose assumptions, clarify intent, and encourage the team to think critically**.

Good engineers don’t need a manager who rubber-stamps decisions. They need someone who **challenges their thinking and sharpens solutions**. It’s not about second-guessing expertise. It’s about cutting through ambiguity and making sure the team isn’t solving the wrong problem.

### **Naïve Questions as a Leadership Tool**

A leader’s responsibility isn’t just to support the strongest voice. It’s to create space for everyone to contribute. Yes, some engineers will have earned more of your trust through experience and technical depth. But their **seniority and vocality can unintentionally drown out others**, especially those who are newer, more reserved, or hesitant to challenge the status quo.

That’s where **naïve questions** come in. Even when your team feels comfortable participating, asking a simple, surface-level question can:

* Help the **author of an idea reframe their thinking** or present their point more clearly.  
* **Invite quieter voices** into the conversation by making the discussion feel more accessible.  
* Highlight assumptions that **might be obvious to one person but invisible to others**.

### **Why Engineering Leaders Should Be Skilled Communicators**

As an engineering leader, your value isn’t just in technical expertise. It’s in your ability to **facilitate clarity** and **drive better discussions**. You’re often best positioned to:

* **Distill complex ideas** into clearer concepts for broader audiences.  
* **Frame questions thoughtfully**, challenging assumptions without dismissing the person behind the idea.  
* **Simplify the conversation** when the discussion becomes too abstract or overly technical for the broader team.

Asking a naïve question isn’t a weakness—it’s a leadership tool. It shows you’re engaged, thinking critically, and creating space for others to contribute meaningfully.

### **The Real Value of Naïve Questions**

The best engineering leaders aren’t the ones with all the answers. They’re the ones who ask the right questions. A well-timed, seemingly simple question can cut through noise, challenge assumptions, and bring clarity when it’s needed most.

It’s not about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about making sure the smart people comprising your team think more clearly.

### **The Power of an Attitude of Naïveté**

Asking naïve questions is valuable, but embracing an **attitude of naïveté** offers even greater power. Leaders who stay curious and unintimidated by the unknown are fearless in the face of uncertainty or ambiguity.

This isn’t a lack of understanding. Instead, it’s a conscious choice to approach complex challenges with curiosity and openness. When combined with resilience, persistence, and intelligence, this mindset becomes a force that drives fearless leadership.

Leaders who maintain this attitude don’t fear what they don’t know—they see ambiguity as an opportunity to learn, explore, and help their teams navigate complexity. A real strength of a good leader lies in their ability to break down overwhelming problems into manageable parts. The goal isn’t to solve everything alone but to dissect uncertainty into clear, actionable pieces that teams can tackle methodically.

Curiosity pushes these leaders to ask better questions. Resilience keeps them moving forward through setbacks. Intelligence helps them find clarity in ambiguity. When these qualities come together, they create leaders who empower their teams to handle complexity with confidence and creativity.

### **TL;DR:**

Naïve questions aren’t about ignorance. They are a tool used to spur clarity and critical thinking, while creating space for everyone to contribute. The best leaders don’t just offer solutions—they ask the questions that help their teams build better ones.

And when curiosity is combined with resilience and intelligence, naïveté becomes a leadership advantage. It gives leaders the courage to confront the unknown and break complexity into clear, manageable steps their teams can tackle.

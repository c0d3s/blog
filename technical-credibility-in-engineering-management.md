### **Technical Credibility in Engineering Management**

Engineering managers don’t need to be the strongest developers on their team—but they **do** at the very least need to retain and display **technical credibility**. This isn’t necessarily about writing production feature code every day (although some EM roles will require it); it’s about being a leader who understands, guides, and gets his hands dirty **with intention** when necessary.

### **Credibility Over Contributions**

On a truly high-performing team, I, personally, won’t be the most capable implementer. That’s a good thing. My job isn’t to out-engineer my engineers. It’s to use my technical background to earn their trust and confidence through advocacy and ownership. An engineering manager will need to build consensus and ensure the right things are being built the right way. 

One has to stay close to the system to **advocate for quality and help remove blockers**. This means understanding the architecture well enough to facilitate and be a meaningful voice in technical discussions, weighing in on design trade-offs, and recognizing areas of fragility. It means caring about the same pain points the team does, like slow CI, flaky tests, and painful deployments. It means pushing for maintainability in practice – not through vague notions of operational excellence or chasing vanity metrics, but by ensuring the team has the time, support, and prioritization needed to atone for past sins and make the codebase clean, maintainable, and extensible. And when cross-team dependencies, tooling gaps, or technical debt stand in the way, it means using your influence to clear a path so the team can move forward.

Through all this, leading isn’t dictating how things should be done. It requires walking the walk and modeling best practices. That means setting the right technical patterns, reinforcing them through documentation, and ensuring knowledge is shared rather than siloed. Whether through code reviews, design discussions, or hands-on guidance, my role is to help establish a foundation that scales, so the team isn’t constantly reinventing solutions but building on a shared understanding of what “good” looks like.

### **When It’s Time to Get Hands-On**

Most of the time, my role is about **enabling the team**. Sometimes, one needs to strategically dirty one’s hands. Not to take over, but to unblock, guide, or protect.

1. Blazing a Trail: If I’m introducing a new methodology, technology, or approach, I’ll often blaze the trail – proving the idea, socializing it with the team, and ensuring alignment. This applies to implementation and process changes equally. The best way I’ve found to propagate positive change is to **model, document, and share**.  
     
2. Priority Outages & Critical Issues: I may not have every implementation detail, but I usually know where to look – recent changes, logs, dashboards, or dependencies that might be the culprit – or at least who to ask. Sometimes, the most valuable thing I can do isn’t to fix the issue myself. It’s knowing who to pull in and what questions to ask.  
     
3. New Partnerships, Integrations, & POCs: Early explorations – eg, partnerships, integrations, or proofs-of-concept – are another area where I get hands-on. I’ve developed a solid sense of how far to take an ambiguous idea before handing it off. My role is to validate the opportunity, define a rough path forward, and ensure we don’t overcommit before providing sufficient clarity.  
     
4. Shielding the Team from Distractions: Not every urgent task is important. If something is high-priority but low-leverage, I’ll step in to absorb the distraction – whether that’s pulling customer data, writing/running migrations for a legacy system, or responding to an ad-hoc executive or marketing request. These tasks aren’t typically difficult or complex, but often require context or details I already have or can intuit. There’s always a cost to context switching, and part of my role is ensuring engineers’ time and energy stays where their unique problem-solving abilities have the strongest impact.

### **TL;DR:**

Engineering managers don’t need to be the strongest developers, but they must be technically credible. That means staying close enough to the work to guide effectively, setting the right patterns, advocating for quality, and removing blockers. It means feeling the team’s pain and using your influence to fix what matters. And when the moment calls for it, it means stepping in – not to do their work, but to blaze the trail, clear the obstacles, and make sure the right work gets done.

Technical leadership isn’t about writing code. It’s about making sure the right code gets written and written well.

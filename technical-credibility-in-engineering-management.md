### **Technical Credibility in Engineering Management**

Engineering managers don’t need to be the strongest developers on their team—but they **do** at very least need to retain and display **technical credibility**. This isn’t necessarily about writing production feature code every day (although some EM roles will absolutely require it); it’s about being a leader who understands, guides, and gets his hands dirty with intention when necessary.

### **Credibility Over Code Contributions**

On a truly high-performing team, I, personally, won’t be the most capable implementer. That’s a good thing. My job isn’t to out-engineer my engineers. It’s to use my technical background to earn their trust and confidence through advocacy and ownership. You will need to build consensus and ensure the right things are being built the right way. 

You have to stay close to the system to advocate for quality and help remove blockers. This means understanding the architecture well enough to facilitate and be a meaningful voice in technical discussions, weighing in on design trade-offs, and recognizing areas of fragility. It means caring about the same pain points the team does—slow CI, flaky tests, painful deployments. It means pushing for maintainability in practice—not through vague promises of operational excellence, but by ensuring the team has the time, support, and prioritization needed to atone for past sins and make the codebase clean and sustainable. And when cross-team dependencies, tooling gaps, or technical debt stand in the way, it means using your influence to clear a path so the team can move forward.

Through all this, leading isn’t dictating how things should be done. It requires walking the walk and modeling best practices. That means setting the right technical patterns, reinforcing them through documentation, and ensuring knowledge is shared rather than siloed. Whether through code reviews, design discussions, or hands-on guidance, my role is to help establish a foundation that scales, so the team isn’t constantly reinventing solutions but building on a shared understanding of what “good” looks like.

### **The Power of Naïve Questions**

A good leader isn’t afraid to ask **naïve questions**. Sometimes because they don’t know anything—that is often true for me—but also because they want to expose assumptions, clarify intent, and help the team think critically. Good engineers appreciate a manager who challenges thinking and works to simplify how solutions are defined, not apply rubber-stamps to decisions.

It’s also your duty to speak up for the sake of your team, not just defer to the loudest or most senior voice. Yes, you likely have engineers that have earned more of your trust, but their seniority and vocality can discourage others from speaking up. Even if they feel comfortable participating, asking a naive question can help the author of an idea reframe the way they are presenting it, adding clarity. An engineering manager should excel in communication, and as such, you may be better equipped to articulate the finer nuances of a question or distill a concept more eloquently.

### **When It’s Time to Get Hands-On**

Most of the time, my role is about **enabling the team**. Sometimes, you need to strategically dirty your hands. 

When the path forward is unclear, I may need to blaze a trail—exploring ambiguous, ill-defined problems, perhaps even creating a beachhead, before handing things off to the team. When things are on fire, sometimes leadership means grabbing a bucket—debugging a critical issue while coordinating a rapid response. And when a deadline is imminent but clarity is lacking, I might need to step in and push an idea forward, cutting through the noise to ensure we deliver. As the size of my teams and the breadth of my scope has increased, these moments have become exceptions, not the rule—but when they happen, the ability to engage at the right level makes all the difference.

### **TL;DR:**

Engineering managers don’t need to be the strongest developers, but they must be technically credible. That means staying close enough to the work to guide effectively, setting the right patterns, advocating for quality, and removing blockers. It means feeling the team’s pain and using your influence to fix what matters. And when the moment calls for it, it means stepping in—not to do their work, but to blaze the trail, clear the obstacles, and make sure the right work gets done.

Technical leadership isn’t about writing code. It’s about making sure the right code gets written—and written well.

### **Great Leaders Make Themselves Obsolete**

If you’re making every decision, you’re the bottleneck. That’s a failure mode. Your job isn’t to own every technical call or unblock every issue. It’s to build a system that runs without you. The more effectively you **remove yourself from day-to-day execution**, the more your team grows, your organization scales, and your career advances.

### **Leadership Is Just Another Layer of Abstraction**

When writing production web applications, we don’t write in machine code or assembly -- we compose in modern languages. We don’t reinvent every low-level function (except perhaps in leetcode) -- we pull in libraries with optimized solutions and focus on applying those solutions where they have an impact. And we often choose to forego managing our own metal when we have cloud infrastructure at our disposal.

Every layer of abstraction frees us to **focus on higher-order problems** and deliver more value. Leadership works the same way.

If you’re personally involved in every detail, you’re working at the lowest level of abstraction. Just as engineers **automate repetitive work**, great leaders **delegate, document, and develop people** to free themselves from low-level execution. They model the behavior they expect to see and pass the baton to their teams to carry forward.

### **Climb the Abstraction Ladder**

1. **Stop Owning Small Decisions** – Build people up over time. Let them take ownership.  
2. **Eliminate Yourself as a Bottleneck** – If everything runs through you, you’ve failed. Create scalable systems.  
3. **Don’t Get Buried in the Weeds** – Your job isn’t to debug every problem. It’s to make sure the right problems are being solved in the first place.

### **This Is How You Advance**

Working yourself out of a job sounds like a terrible job security plan. It’s not. The more you enable your team to **run without you**, the more you free yourself to **focus on higher-leverage work**: strategy, alignment, and big-picture thinking.

Your team doesn’t need you making every decision. They need you **looking ahead.** The only way to do that is to **climb higher and get out of their way.**

This isn't to promote negligence. You should remain connected and informed. After all, you must represent your team across the breadth of the organization, and there may be bottlenecks on your team you are uniquely equipped to solve. You must build the ability to discern these bottenecks and insert yourself deliberately, not by default.

### **TL;DR:**

Great leaders scale themselves by **removing themselves from execution** and focusing on strategy. The less they’re needed for daily decisions, the **more valuable they become.**

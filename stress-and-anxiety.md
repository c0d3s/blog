### **Regulate Stress, Reduce Anxiety**

As a team leader, your job isn’t to apply stress—it’s to **regulate it**. Stress is a natural response to challenge: a tough deadline, a big customer to support, a complex feature, a high standard of quality. Your team doesn’t need you to manufacture urgency—they just need to **understand the stakes**.

Anxiety, however, is different. Anxiety isn’t just stress—it’s **chronic unease**, a sense of impending failure without a clear way out. I’d argue that a primary cause of anxiety is a **real or perceived lack of control, influence, or autonomy**. When people feel powerless in high-stakes situations, they spiral. Your job as a leader is to **ward this off**.

### **Stress vs. Anxiety: The Grid of Control and Stakes**

Imagine a 2D grid:

* **X-axis: Control** – The degree to which someone can influence the outcome.  
* **Y-axis: Stakes** – The significance of what can be won or lost.

Different combinations of these variables create different emotional states:

| Control ↓ / Stakes → | Low Stakes | High Stakes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **High Control** | Ease (until boredom sets in) | Pressure (can be exhilarating or crushing) |
| **Low Control** | Demotivation (leads to disengagement) | Anxiety (crippling, chronic stress) |

* **High stakes \+ high control \= pressure.** This can be motivating or overwhelming, depending on how the team is managed. Some people thrive here, others burn out.  
* **High stakes \+ low control \= anxiety.** This is where things get dangerous. At worst, you feel powerless, like there's a guillotine over your head; your fate is in the hands controlled by the masked executioner at the lever.  
* **Low stakes \+ high control \= ease.** It’s comfortable for a time, though comfort may give way to boredom.  
* **Low stakes \+ low control \= disengagement.** When people have no control and nothing meaningful at stake, they check out. And once someone checks out, it’s hard to bring them back.

### **How to Reduce Anxiety and Maintain Healthy Stress**

You can’t eliminate stress, nor should you. **But you can balance it.**

* **Give your team control over how they solve problems.** Ownership turns anxiety into motivation.  
* **Set clear expectations.** Stress without clarity is just chaos.  
* **Create psychological safety.** Your team needs to know they can fail, learn, and recover.  
* **Provide resources, not just pressure.** High stakes with no support leads to burnout, not excellence.

### **High Control, High Stakes (But Not Forever)**

Great teams thrive under pressure—not under a constant sense of doom. Your job isn’t to apply stress. It’s to create the right conditions for people to rise to the occasion.

But no team can operate in a high-stakes environment indefinitely. Pressure needs to come in waves—intense sprints followed by periods of recovery and stability. Sustained high-pressure environments don’t lead to greatness; they lead to exhaustion, short-term thinking, and burnout.

The best teams aren’t just resilient under pressure—they’re given the space to recharge so they can rise to the occasion again when it matters. Balance isn’t just about reducing anxiety—it’s about managing intensity over time.

### **TL;DR:**

Stress is natural and can be motivating, but anxiety is corrosive. **Anxiety happens when stakes are high but control is low.** As a leader, your job is to **increase control, provide clarity, and create a safe environment where people can thrive under pressure—without being crushed by it.**
